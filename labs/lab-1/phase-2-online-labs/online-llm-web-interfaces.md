# 🌐 Online LLM Web Interfaces (Free Tier Access)
This guide lists recommended online LLM platforms that support free‑tier access via Gmail or personal email registration. Students should use the **same Gmail ID** across all platforms for consistency and ease of access.

## 🧪 Suggested Student Activity

### Prompt:  
> "List three ethical risks of deploying autonomous agents in education."

**Instructions**:  
1. Run the prompt on at least **three platforms**  
2. Compare:  
   - Depth of reasoning  
   - Ethical framing  
   - Clarity and tone  
   - Hallucination or bias  
3. Document findings in a markdown table  
4. Reflect on which model best aligned with the prompt intent and why  

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Instructor Notes
- Encourage students to log prompt versions and outputs for reproducibility  
- Use this lab to introduce model evaluation heuristics and prompt debugging  
- Reinforce ethical awareness and critical thinking in GenAI deployment  
- Discuss differences in model behaviour across platforms  

---

## 🧠 Outcome
- Students gain hands‑on experience with hosted LLMs  
- Learn to compare outputs across models and platforms  
- Build awareness of prompt engineering and evaluation strategies  
- All platforms are free and student‑friendly
