# Glossary - Licensing, Bias, and Ethical AI
**Reference for Lecture 4B and Capstone Ethics Discussions**

This glossary defines key terms related to licensing, bias, safety, and ethical alignment in GenAI systems. These concepts support responsible deployment and critical evaluation of AI models.


## Bias and Safety Terminology

| Term                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model Bias               | Systematic errors or unfair outcomes based on training data or design       |
| Hallucination            | AI-generated output that is plausible (reasonable) but factually incorrect               |
| Adversarial Robustness   | Model's ability to resist manipulation or malicious inputs                  |
| Explainable AI (XAI)     | Techniques that make AI decisions transparent and interpretable             |
| Value Alignment          | Ensuring AI systems reflect human values and ethical principles             |
| X-risk                   | Potential existential risks posed by highly advanced AI systems             |
| Red Teaming              | Stress-testing AI systems for safety, bias, and failure modes               |
| Human Oversight          | Involving humans in monitoring and correcting AI decisions                  |
| Ethical Deployment       | Responsible release and use of AI systems with safeguards and transparency  |
| Consent and Privacy      | Ensuring user data is handled with permission and confidentiality           |


## Instructor Notes

Use this glossary to scaffold Lecture 4B and capstone ethics discussions. Encourage students to explore model cards, licensing terms, and bias mitigation strategies. Reinforce the importance of transparency and accountability in GenAI workflows.
