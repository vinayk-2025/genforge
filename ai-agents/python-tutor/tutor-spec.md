# 🐍 Python Tutor Agent Specification

## Purpose
The Python Tutor agent is designed to assist learners in understanding Python programming concepts, generating code snippets, and practicing through quizzes. It leverages a locally available lightweight LLM (via Ollama) to ensure fast, offline, resource‑friendly operation.

## Scope
- **Concept Explanations**: Provide clear, step‑by‑step explanations of Python topics (e.g., recursion, list comprehensions).
- **Code Generation**: Generate Python code snippets for algorithms, data structures, and practical tasks.
- **Quiz Creation**: Produce multiple‑choice questions (MCQs) for self‑assessment on specific Python topics.
- **Logging**: Record queries and responses for review and dashboard display.

## Inputs
- **User Query**: Free‑form text entered in the Streamlit interface.
- **Intent Detection**: Classify query into one of three categories:
  - Explanation
  - Code Generation
  - Quiz Creation

## Outputs
- **Response Text**: Generated by the LLM (tinyllama via Ollama).
- **Logs**: Stored locally in a database or CSV file for dashboard visualization.
- **Dashboard View**: Tabular display of FAQs, queries, and responses.

## Constraints
- Must run locally using Ollama (`tinyllama:latest`).
- Lightweight footprint suitable for student laptops.
- Clear separation of concerns:
  - Prompt templates in `/prompts/`
  - Frontend in `app.py`
  - Documentation in `README.md`, `workflow.md`
- Responses must be concise, accurate, and beginner‑friendly.

## Success Criteria
- Handles typos gracefully (e.g., "recusrion" → "recursion").
- Generates runnable Python code snippets.
- Produces quizzes with correct answers and plausible distractors.
- Provides a clean Streamlit interface with agent + dashboard tabs.
