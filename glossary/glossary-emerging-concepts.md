## Student Reflection Prompts

- How might neuromorphic computing reshape AI hardware and energy efficiency?
- What ethical safeguards are needed to manage X-risk?
- How does multimodal AI enhance user interaction in real-world applications?
- Why is value alignment critical in autonomous decision-making?
- What are the trade-offs between federated learning and centralised training?
