# Glossary – Agentic AI vs Autonomous Systems
**Reference for Lecture 3A and 4B**

This glossary clarifies the distinction between agentic AI and autonomous systems. It supports student understanding of how goal-driven agents evolve into systems capable of sustained, independent operation.

## Comparative Table

| Concept            | Agentic AI                                           | Autonomous Systems                                      |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition         | AI that takes actions using tools, memory, and reasoning | Systems that operate independently over time with minimal human input |
| Scope              | Task-oriented, often short-lived or bounded          | Long-term, environment-aware, self-sustaining            |
| Human Involvement  | May require human prompts, goals, or oversight       | Designed to function with minimal or no human intervention |
| Examples           | Tool-using LLM agents, RAG pipelines, copilots       | Self-driving cars, autonomous drones, robotic warehouses |
| Dependencies       | Often rely on APIs, toolchains, or external memory   | Integrate sensing, planning, and control internally      |
| Evaluation         | Based on task completion, reasoning trace, tool use  | Based on safety, adaptability, and mission success       |

## Student Reflection Prompts

- What makes an AI system “agentic” even if it’s not fully autonomous?
- How do multi-agent systems contribute to emergent autonomy?
- Where do you draw the line between tool-using agents and autonomous systems?
- What are the risks of deploying autonomous systems without explainability?
- How might agentic design principles improve human-AI collaboration?

## Instructor Notes

Use this glossary to scaffold Lecture 3A’s conceptual arc and Lecture 4B’s discussion on safety and autonomy. Encourage students to compare agentic workflows (e.g., tool-calling LLMs) with real-world autonomous systems (e.g., drones, robots, vehicles).
