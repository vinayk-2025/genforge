# Glossary – Evolution of AI to Agentic Systems
**Conceptual Arc for Lecture 3A and 3B**

This glossary traces the evolution of artificial intelligence from symbolic systems to agentic autonomy. It supports conceptual clarity before diving into model architectures, prompting strategies, and orchestration workflows.

## Evolutionary Timeline

| Stage                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Artificial Intelligence (AI) | Broad field focused on machines performing tasks requiring human-like intelligence |
| Machine Learning (ML)     | Algorithms that learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions   |
| Deep Learning (DL)        | Subset of ML using multi-layered neural networks for complex data analysis |
| Large Language Models (LLMs) | AI models trained on vast text corpora to understand and generate human-like language |
| Generative AI (GenAI)     | AI systems that create new content (text, image, audio, code) based on prompts |
| AI Agents                 | Goal-driven programs that interact with environments using AI techniques   |
| Multi-Agent Systems       | Multiple agents collaborating to solve complex tasks or simulate ecosystems |
| Agentic AI                | Autonomous systems with tools, memory, reasoning, and decision-making capabilities |
| Autonomous Systems        | AI systems operating independently over time with minimal human oversight  |
| Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) | Hypothetical AI with human-level understanding across diverse tasks and domains |

## Student Reflection Prompts

- How does GenAI differ from traditional rule-based AI?
- What role do agents play in making AI systems more autonomous?
- Which stage of the AI evolution feels most relevant to your current learning?
- What are the risks and opportunities of AGI?
- How might multimodal AI change how we interact with machines?

## Instructor Notes

This glossary anchors the conceptual arc of Lectures 3A and 3B. It should be revisited before exploring model internals, chaining, and orchestration. Encourage students to annotate the timeline and reflect on where GenAI fits in the broader AI landscape.
