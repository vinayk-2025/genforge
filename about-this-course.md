# About This Course  
**Generative AI, Prompt Engineering & Agentic Systems**  
A modular, open-source, instructor-led course designed and delivered by **Satya Prakash Nigam**, Independent AI Consultant.


## Course Overview

- Understand the architecture and capabilities of foundation models (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini)  
- Learn prompt engineering techniques for coding, reasoning, search, and creative tasks  
- Explore agentic AI systems: autonomous workflows, tool use, and memory  
- Build mini-projects using open-source GenAI platforms and APIs  
- Discuss emerging trends: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-modal agents, and AI safety  


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will:

- Design, evaluate, and deploy GenAI workflows using prompt engineering, tool use, and agentic logic  
- Demonstrate ethical awareness, technical fluency, and professional habits in building autonomous AI systems  
- Create reproducible, documented, and deployable GenAI artifacts for real-world applications  


## Hardware & Software Requirements
