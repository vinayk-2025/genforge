# About This Course  
**Generative AI, Prompt Engineering & Agentic Systems**  
A modular, open-source, instructor-led course designed and delivered by **Satya Prakash Nigam**, Independent AI Consultant.

---

## Course Objectives

1. Introduce learners to the principles and applications of Generative AI, including large language models and multi-modal systems  
2. Equip participants with practical skills in prompt engineering, agentic workflows, and ethical deployment of autonomous AI systems  
3. Foster professional habits in building, evaluating, and sharing GenAI artifacts using reproducible workflows, modular design, and open-source platforms  

---

## Course Overview

- Understand the architecture and capabilities of foundation models (e.g., GPT, Claude, Gemini)  
- Learn prompt engineering techniques for coding, reasoning, search, and creative tasks  
- Explore agentic AI systems: autonomous workflows, tool use, and memory  
- Build mini-projects using open-source GenAI platforms and APIs  
- Discuss emerging trends: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-modal agents, and AI safety  

---

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming  
- Familiarity with core AI concepts (e.g., supervised learning, ML pipelines)
