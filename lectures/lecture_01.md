## Scope
This launch session lays the groundwork for your journey into Generative AI, Prompt Engineering, and Agentic Systems. You will explore the course structure, learning philosophy, and tooling ecosystem that will guide your progress. By the end of this session, you will have your local environment configured, validated, and conceptually aligned for agentic workflows.

---

## Objectives
- Understand the modular structure and weekly rhythm of the course  
- Explore key tools: Python, Streamlit, LangChain, Hugging Face, Ollama, Gemini CLI  
- Set up and validate your local development environment for CLI and Python workflows  
- Learn four distinct ways to send prompts to LLMs  
- Deploy your first GenAI app using Streamlit Cloud  
- Establish norms for GitHub hygiene, version control, and documentation  
- Practice reproducibility with `requirements.txt` and GitHub integration  
- Prepare for agentic workflows and prompt chaining in Lecture 02  

---

## Key Concepts
- Value-added learning and modular curriculum design  
- GenAI vs traditional AI: framing the paradigm shift  
- Local-first development and open-source tooling  
- Reproducibility, version control, and professional habits  
- Prompt delivery workflows: Web UI, CLI, Python scripting, Python API
