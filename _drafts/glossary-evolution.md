# Glossary - Evolution of AI to Agentic Systems
**Conceptual Arc for Lecture 3A and 3B**

This glossary traces the evolution of artificial intelligence from symbolic systems to agentic autonomy. It supports conceptual clarity before diving into model architectures, prompting strategies, and orchestration workflows.


## Key Concepts

| Term                     | Definition                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Symbolic AI              | Early rule-based systems using logic and knowledge representation          |
| Neural Network           | Interconnected nodes mimicking brain-like processing for pattern recognition |
| Attention Mechanism      | Technique allowing models to focus on relevant input segments              |
| Transformer Architecture | Model design enabling parallelism and long-range dependencies              |
| Pretraining              | Initial training on broad data to learn general patterns                   |
| Fine-tuning              | Adapting pretrained models to specific tasks or domains                    |
| RLHF                     | Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback - aligns models with human preferences |
| Emergent Behaviours      | Capabilities that arise unexpectedly as model scale increases              |
| Scaling Laws             | Predictive relationships between model size and performance                |
| Multimodal AI            | AI systems integrating text, image, audio, and video inputs                |


## Instructor Notes

This glossary anchors the conceptual arc of Lectures 3A and 3B. It should be revisited before exploring model internals, chaining, and orchestration. Encourage students to annotate the timeline and reflect on where GenAI fits in the broader AI landscape.
