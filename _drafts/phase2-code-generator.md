# 💻 Online Code Generator Lab
This lab introduces students to free, browser‑based code generation tools. Each platform supports Gmail login or no login at all, and allows students to experiment with prompt‑driven coding across multiple languages.


## 🎯 Suggested Lab Activity

### Prompt:  
> "Generate a Python script that reads a CSV file and prints the average of a numeric column."

**Instructions**:  
1. Run the prompt on at least **two platforms**  
2. Compare:  
   - Syntax correctness  
   - Output formatting  
   - Error handling  
   - Comments and readability  
3. Paste results into a markdown table  
4. Reflect on which tool offered the most usable code and why  


## 🧪 Outcome
- Students gain hands‑on experience with prompt‑driven code generation  
- Learn to evaluate and debug AI‑generated code  
- Build awareness of tool limitations and prompt engineering strategies
