# Glossary - Multimodal AI Concepts
**Reference for Lecture 3B and 4A**

This glossary defines key terms and examples related to multimodal AI - systems that process and generate across multiple data types. These concepts support your understanding of cross-domain prompting and multimodal model capabilities.

## Core Terminology

| Term                         | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multimodal AI                | AI systems that integrate and process multiple data types (text, image, audio, video) |
| Text-to-Image Generation     | Generating images from textual prompts using models like DALL·E or Stable Diffusion |
| Image-to-Text Captioning     | Generating descriptive text from image inputs using models like BLIP or Gemini Vision |
| Text-to-Audio Synthesis      | Generating speech or sound from text using models like TTS or Bark           |
| Audio-to-Text Transcription  | Converting spoken audio into written text using models like Whisper or Gemini Audio |
| Video Understanding          | Analysing video content for objects, actions, or summaries using multimodal models |
| Cross-Modal Reasoning        | Using information from one modality to infer or generate in another          |
| Multimodal Prompting         | Crafting prompts that combine text with image/audio/video inputs             |
| Vision-Language Models (VLMs)| Models trained to understand both visual and textual inputs simultaneously  |
| Multimodal Embeddings        | Unified vector representations across modalities for retrieval and reasoning |

## Student Reflection Prompts

- How does multimodal AI differ from traditional single-modality models?
- What are the challenges in aligning image and text representations?
- Which industries benefit most from multimodal capabilities?
- How can multimodal prompting improve accessibility and user experience?
- What ethical considerations arise in video and audio synthesis?

## Instructor Notes

Use this glossary to scaffold Lecture 3B demos and Lecture 4A comparisons. Encourage students to experiment with multimodal prompts in Gemini CLI, Hugging Face Spaces, or Perplexity. Reinforce the idea that multimodal AI expands GenAI beyond text.
