# Glossary - Agentic AI vs Autonomous Systems
**Reference for Lecture 3A and 4B**

This glossary clarifies the distinction between agentic AI and autonomous systems. It supports student understanding of how goal-driven agents evolve into systems capable of sustained, independent operation.

## Instructor Notes

Use this glossary to scaffold Lecture 3A's conceptual arc and Lecture 4B's discussion on safety and autonomy. Encourage students to compare agentic workflows (e.g., tool-calling LLMs) with real-world autonomous systems (e.g., drones, robots, vehicles).
